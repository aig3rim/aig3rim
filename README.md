I'm an engineer turned data scientist who loves finding insights from data. I strongly believe that by having a better understanding of data and applying machine learning algorithms we can make the world a better place. 

Currently, I'm a Data Scientist at Rakuten helping external clinets to make a better business decisions through providing insights. In my free time, I enjoy learning new things and share my knowledge through my blog posts and knowledge share talks at my company.

Outside of work, I also...
- 📝 Write about data science, machine learning and marketing
- 🏃‍♀️ Run 7-8 km 3 times a week
- 📚 Read about cognitive & social psychology, enjoy classic and contemporary literature
- 🇯🇵 Study Japanese (日本語)
- 🌱 I'm currently learning/improving knowledge in statistics, deep learning, story-telling, data structures & algorithms
