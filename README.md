I'm an engineer turned data scientist who loves finding insights from data. I strongly believe that by having a better understanding of data and applying machine learning algorithms we can make the world a better place. 

Currently, I'm a Data Scientist at Rakuten helping various external clients to make a better business decisions through providing insights. In my free time, I enjoy learning new things and sharing my knowledge through my blog posts.

Outside of work, I also...
- 📝 Write about data science, machine learning and marketing
- 🏃‍♀️ Run 7-8 km 3 times a week
- 📚 Read about cognitive & social psychology, enjoy classic and contemporary literature
- 🐶 Walk and go to dog parks with our dog Taquito
- 🌱 I'm currently learning/improving knowledge in statistics & probability, deep learning, story-telling
